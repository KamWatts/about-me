      <p>Hello there and welcome to my page. First, let me introduce myself. My name is Ryan Bagan, and I am a US NAVY Veteran. I served for 16 years and I was overseas for the entirety of my active duty service. I was in Japan for 15 years and 1 year in Bahrain. I was part of Supply Department as a Culinary Specialist and also performed different titles and positions such as Departmental 3M Coordinator, Leading Petty Officer, Assistant Leading Petty Officer, Watch Bill Coordinator, MWR President, Damage Control Training Team, and other jobs that I need to recall. I was also part of Naval Base Kitsap Force Protection Security which dealt with anti-terrorism force protection</p>
