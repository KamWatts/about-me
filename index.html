    <p>Hello there and welcome to my page. First, let me introduce myself. My name is Ryan Bagan, and I am a US NAVY
      Veteran. I served for 16 years and I was overseas for the entirety of my active duty service. I was in Japan for
      15 years and 1 year in Bahrain. Japan was lovely and it felt like home to me. Wish I could stay forever but I have
      to come home and establish my life here. But anyway, going back, I was part of Supply Department as a Culinary
      Specialist and also performed
      different titles and positions such as Departmental 3M Coordinator, Leading Petty Officer, Assistant Leading Petty
      Officer, Watch Bill Coordinator, MWR President, Damage Control Training Team, and other jobs that I need to
      recall. I was also part of Naval Base Kitsap Force Protection Security which controlled and secured entry control
      points, protection duties including use of deadly force, knowledge of weaponry, anti-terrorism, and combat arms.
      Sounds like a boring life eh? Well, let' see... in my spare my spare time I play sports. Basketball, boxing, and
      billiards to name a few. I also play video games, PS4 or PS5. But I mostly play Tekken online as it is my way of
      relieving stress and forgetting the problems of reality. My past education includes a Bachelor of Science in
      Industrial Technology Major in Drafting, which I aquired at Bulacan State University in the Philippines. I had my
      credentials converted by World Education Services so I can use that for job applications. I also acquired
      certifications through Coursera. I have Homeland Security and CyberSecurity certification from University of
      Colorado, Introduction to CyberSecurity Specialization certification from New York University, and Python for
      Everybody Specialization certification from University of Michigan. I am now taking programming class at Code
      Fellows as a
      change of career. And as a Student Software Engineer, I want to be really proficient at this field so that I can
      achieve my plans and goals in life not just for me, but also for my family.
